# PerpetualShred
Never-ending gnar.
https://www.perpetualshred.com

Perpetual Shred is a combination of two projects:

1. A web-crawler that searches a set of websites for sick mountain bike shredits, and
2. A web site that by-default displays these videos randomly and endlessly with a nice looking single-page interface.

Getting set up:

npm install  -g webpack webpack-dev-server

cd to /PerpetualShred

npm i -f
